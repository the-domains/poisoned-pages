# The Village in Shadow

A few weeks ago, someone over on the Google+ Community asked for more novice adventures, so I decided to see if I could make one. Seeing as how on I recently talked about the 3-act story structure on [my podcast][0], I decided to make an adventure using said structure.

## Crasmere

In brief, the story revolves around Crasmere, a village with a dark stain in its past, but a safe and prosperous present. Unfortunately, that present is built upon the blood sacrifices of the guilty and innocent alike.

The player characters arrive in Crasmere just as things are heating up: the pool of sacrificial victims is running dry. Will they be able to save the village from the cult?Will the PCs do so, knowing that the sacrifices are keeping the rest of the population safe?

You can find the [PDF here][1].

I hope that this adventure works well for you. Any comments, suggestions, etc. leave them in the comments below and we'll see about getting it fixed.
